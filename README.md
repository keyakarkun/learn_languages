# 🚀 Code Language Learning Challenge

Welcome to my self-challenge repository where I’m learning various programming languages within a specific time frame! 💻📚

## 📌 About This Repo

This repository serves as a personal log and resource hub as I challenge myself to learn different programming languages in a structured and time-bound way. I’ll be uploading all the essential files I use during this journey — from beginner-level notes to small projects and practice exercises.

## 📅 Challenge Format

- ⏱️ Set a timeframe for each language (e.g., 7/15/30 days)
- 📘 Learn the basics (syntax, data types, control flow, functions, etc.)
- 🛠️ Build small projects or complete exercises
- 📝 Document what I learn along the way

## 🧠 Languages Covered

- ✅ Python – *(Completed in X days)*
- ⏳ Java – *(In Progress)*
- 🔜 JavaScript – *(Coming Soon)*
- 🔜 C++
- 🔜 SQL
- 🔜 HTML/CSS

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each language will have its own folder, organized like so:

- language_name---> Notes


## ✨ Goals

- Build a strong foundation in multiple languages
- Stay consistent with daily learning
- Track progress publicly to stay motivated
- Encourage others to start their own learning challenges!

## 📢 Get Involved

If you're also learning a language or want to take on a similar challenge, feel free to fork the repo, leave feedback, or suggest improvements and resources! Let's grow together 💪
